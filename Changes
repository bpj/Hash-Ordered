Revision history for Hash-Ordered

{{$NEXT}}

    [Added]

    - Added 'preinc', 'postinc', 'predec', 'postdec', 'add', 'subtract',
      'concat', 'or_equals' and 'dor_equals' functions for efficient
      in-place modification of hash elements.

    [Changed]

    - The 'keys' method in scalar context now returns an optimized
      count of keys.

    [Fixed]

    - Keys in the internal ordered list of keys are now stringified so
      they are in exactly the same form as they would be in a Perl hash.
      This slows construction slightly, but is necessary for correctness.

    - Added explicit stringification and numification overloads to mimic an
      unoverloaded object rather than falling back on the result of
      boolification.

    [Optimized]

    - Added indexed tombstone deletion for hashes over 25 elements; this
      makes deletion faster than all other pure-Perl ordered hash
      implementations that I benchmarked.

    - Numerous functions micro-optimized, including get and set.
